/**
 * Jenkins Pipeline: Direct Branch Build Trigger
 *
 * Lightweight router triggered by GitLab webhook on push to dev or stage branches.
 * Directly triggers the MultiBranch Pipeline branch job, bypassing the slow scan.
 *
 * This is the "direct trigger" pattern - industry best practice for event-driven CI/CD.
 * Instead of: webhook → scan all branches → find changed branch → build
 * We do:      webhook → trigger specific branch build directly
 *
 * Flow:
 *   - Push to dev   → triggers k8s-deployments/dev build
 *   - Push to stage → triggers k8s-deployments/stage build
 *   - Push to prod  → triggers k8s-deployments/prod build (if configured)
 *
 * The actual promotion logic lives in the main Jenkinsfile (createPromotionMR).
