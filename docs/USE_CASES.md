# K8s-Deployments Use Cases

This document defines the demonstration use cases for the deployment pipeline, showcasing how platform teams manage Kubernetes configurations across environments using CUE-based GitOps.

**Categories A-D** focus on infrastructure and configuration changes that flow through the CUE layering system. **Category E** covers the application code lifecycle from commit to production.

## Overview

### CUE Configuration Layers

```
Platform (services/base/, services/core/)
    │
    │  Provides: defaults, schemas, templates
    │  Example: default labels, security contexts, deployment strategies
    │
    ▼
App (services/apps/*.cue)
    │
    │  Provides: app-specific config that applies to ALL environments
    │  Example: app env vars, app annotations, app-level ConfigMap defaults
    │
    ▼
Env (env.cue per branch: dev, stage, prod)
    │
    │  Provides: environment-specific overrides
    │  Example: replicas, resources, debug flags, env-specific ConfigMap values
    │
    ▼
Generated Manifests (manifests/<app>/<app>.yaml)
```

### Override Semantics

Each layer can override values from the layer above:
- **Env overrides App**: Production can set `replicas: 3` even if app defaults to `1`
- **App overrides Platform**: An app can disable Prometheus scraping even if platform enables it by default
- **Lower layer wins**: The most specific (lowest) layer takes precedence

### Change Propagation

| Change Location | Propagates To | Mechanism |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| `env.cue` on dev | Dev only | Direct commit to branch |
| `services/apps/*.cue` | All envs for that app | Merge main → env branches |
| `services/base/` or `services/core/` | All apps, all envs | Merge main → env branches |

---

## Category A: Environment-Specific Configuration

Changes made to `env.cue` on a single environment branch. These intentionally **do NOT propagate** to other environments.

### UC-A1: Adjust Replica Count

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform operator, I want to scale dev to 2 replicas for load testing without affecting stage/prod" |
| **Change Location** | `env.cue` on `dev` branch |
| **Change** | `replicas: 1` → `replicas: 2` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Dev deploys with 2 pods; stage/prod unchanged |
| **Validates** | Environment isolation; promotion preserves target's replicas |

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-a1-replicas.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-a1-replicas.sh) (implements UC-A1)

### UC-A2: Enable Debug Mode

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a developer, I want debug logging in dev but not in prod" |
| **Change Location** | `env.cue` on `dev` branch |
| **Change** | `debug: true` (dev) vs `debug: false` (prod) |
| **Expected Behavior** | Dev gets DEBUG env var and debug service; prod does not |
| **Validates** | Environment-specific flags don't leak to production

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-a2-debug-mode.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-a2-debug-mode.sh) (implements UC-A2) |

### UC-A3: Environment-Specific ConfigMap Entry

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform operator, I want dev to use a different Redis URL than prod" |
| **Change Location** | `env.cue` on `dev` branch |
| **Change** | `configMap.data."redis-url": "redis://redis.dev.svc:6379"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Dev ConfigMap has dev Redis; prod ConfigMap has prod Redis |
| **Validates** | ConfigMap entries set in env.cue are environment-specific |

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-a3-env-configmap.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-a3-env-configmap.sh) (implements UC-A3)

---

## Category B: App-Level Cross-Environment Configuration

Changes made to `services/apps/<app>.cue`. These **SHOULD propagate** to all environments for that app (via merge from main to environment branches).

### UC-B1: Add App Environment Variable

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As an app team, we need a new FEATURE_FLAGS env var in all environments" |
| **Change Location** | `services/apps/example-app.cue` → `appEnvVars` |
| **Change** | Add `{name: "FEATURE_FLAGS", value: "new-checkout,dark-mode"}` |
| **Expected Behavior** | After propagation, all envs (dev/stage/prod) have the new env var |
| **Validates** | App-level env vars flow through without manual intervention |

### UC-B2: Add App-Level Annotation

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform team, we want to set app-specific Prometheus scrape timeout" |
| **Change Location** | `services/apps/example-app.cue` → `appConfig.deployment.podAnnotations` |
| **Change** | Add `"prometheus.io/scrape-timeout": "30s"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | All envs get the annotation; env.cue doesn't need to specify it |
| **Validates** | App-level appConfig fields inherit to all envs via CUE unification |
| **Note** | Uses scrape-timeout (not scrape) since prometheus.io/scrape is set at platform level |

### UC-B3: Add App-Level ConfigMap Entry

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As an app team, we need a consistent cache-ttl setting across all environments" |
| **Change Location** | `services/apps/example-app.cue` → `appConfig.configMap.data` |
| **Change** | Add `"cache-ttl": "300"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | All envs get cache-ttl=300 in ConfigMap; envs can override if needed |
| **Validates** | App-level ConfigMap entries propagate; env-level can still override |

### UC-B4: App ConfigMap with Environment Override

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "App sets cache-ttl=300, but prod needs cache-ttl=600 for performance" |
| **Change Location** | App: `services/apps/example-app.cue`; Override: `env.cue` on `prod` |
| **Change** | App sets `"cache-ttl": "300"`; Prod's env.cue sets `"cache-ttl": "600"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Dev/stage get 300; prod gets 600 |
| **Validates** | Environment override takes precedence over app-level default |

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-b4-app-override.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-b4-app-override.sh) (implements UC-B4)

### UC-B5: App-Level Probe with Environment Override

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "App defines readiness probe with 10s timeout, but prod needs 30s due to cold-start characteristics" |
| **Change Location** | App: `services/apps/example-app.cue` → `appConfig.deployment.readinessProbe`; Override: `env.cue` on `prod` |
| **Change** | App sets `timeoutSeconds: 10`; Prod's env.cue sets `timeoutSeconds: 30` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Dev/stage use 10s timeout; prod uses 30s |
| **Validates** | Environment can override any app-level appConfig field (clean CUE merge) |

### UC-B6: App-Level Env Var with Environment Override

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "App sets LOG_LEVEL=INFO as default, but dev needs LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG for troubleshooting" |
| **Change Location** | App: `services/apps/example-app.cue` → `appEnvVars`; Override: `env.cue` on `dev` → `additionalEnv` |
| **Change** | App sets `{name: "LOG_LEVEL", value: "INFO"}`; Dev's env.cue sets `{name: "LOG_LEVEL", value: "DEBUG"}` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Stage/prod use INFO; dev uses DEBUG |
| **Design Note** | Uses `#MergeEnvVars` helper to merge env vars by name. `additionalEnv` values override `appEnvVars` values with the same name. |
| **Validates** | Env var override pattern with proper merge-by-name semantics |

---

## Category C: Platform-Wide Configuration

Changes made to `services/base/` (defaults/schema) or `services/core/` (templates). These **SHOULD propagate** to all apps in all environments.

### UC-C1: Add Default Label to All Deployments

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform team, we need all deployments to have a `cost-center` label for chargeback reporting" |
| **Change Location** | `services/core/app.cue` → `defaultLabels` |
| **Change** | Add `"cost-center": "platform-shared"` to defaultLabels |
| **Expected Behavior** | All apps in all envs get the label; apps/envs can override if needed |
| **Validates** | Template-level changes propagate universally |

### UC-C2: Add Pod Security Context

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a security team, we require all pods to run as non-root" |
| **Change Location** | `services/base/defaults.cue` → `#DefaultPodSecurityContext`; referenced in `services/resources/deployment.cue` |
| **Change** | Enable `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 1000` |
| **Expected Behavior** | All deployments across all apps/envs get the security context |
| **Validates** | Base defaults flow through templates to all generated manifests |

### UC-C3: Change Default Deployment Strategy

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform team, we want zero-downtime deployments as the default" |
| **Change Location** | `services/base/defaults.cue` → `#DefaultDeploymentStrategy` |
| **Change** | Change `maxUnavailable: 1` → `maxUnavailable: 0` |
| **Expected Behavior** | All apps default to zero-downtime unless explicitly overridden |
| **Validates** | Changing base defaults affects all consumers |

### UC-C4: Add Standard Pod Annotation

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform team, we want to set a default Prometheus scrape interval for all pods" |
| **Change Location** | `services/core/app.cue` → `defaultPodAnnotations` |
| **Change** | Add `"prometheus.io/scrape-interval": "30s"` to defaultPodAnnotations |
| **Expected Behavior** | All deployments get the scrape-interval annotation; apps/envs can override if needed |
| **Validates** | Platform-wide defaults propagate to all apps in all environments |
| **Note** | The baseline already includes `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`, `/port`, `/path`. This demo adds a new annotation to demonstrate the mechanism. |

### UC-C5: Platform Default with App Override

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Platform sets Prometheus scraping on, but legacy-app needs it off" |
| **Change Location** | Platform: `services/core/app.cue`; Override: `services/apps/legacy-app.cue` |
| **Change** | Platform sets `"prometheus.io/scrape": "true"`; legacy-app sets `"prometheus.io/scrape": "false"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Most apps get scraping enabled; legacy-app has it disabled across all its envs |
| **Validates** | App layer can override platform defaults |

### UC-C6: Platform Default with Environment Override

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Platform sets cost-center=platform-shared, but prod overrides to cost-center=production-critical" |
| **Change Location** | Platform: `services/core/app.cue`; Override: `env.cue` on `prod` |
| **Change** | Platform sets `"cost-center": "platform-shared"`; prod's env.cue sets `"cost-center": "production-critical"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Dev/stage get platform-shared; prod gets production-critical |
| **Validates** | Full override chain: Platform → App → Env |

---

## Category D: Operational Scenarios

Changes that bypass or modify the normal promotion chain. These handle real-world operational needs that don't fit the happy-path flow.

**Note:** These scenarios require direct env→env MR support with proper env.cue preservation. Current implementation doesn't support this — merging dev→stage directly overwrites stage's env.cue. See Implementation Notes below.

### UC-D1: Emergency Hotfix to Production

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Prod is broken. I need to deploy a fix immediately without waiting for dev→stage→prod" |
| **Trigger** | Direct MR to `prod` branch (or direct commit if MR review is waived) |
| **Change** | Image tag update, config fix, or rollback to known-good state |
| **Expected Behavior** | Prod deploys the fix; dev/stage are NOT affected; promotion chain is bypassed |
| **Constraint** | Must still preserve prod's env.cue (namespace, replicas, resources) |
| **Validates** | Direct env MRs work correctly; env.cue is preserved even when bypassing chain |

### UC-D2: Cherry-Pick Promotion (Multi-App)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Dev has new versions of both example-app and postgres. I want to promote only example-app to stage, hold postgres back" |
| **Trigger** | Manual promotion MR that includes only example-app changes |
| **Change** | Selective image/config promotion for one app |
| **Expected Behavior** | Stage gets new example-app; stage's postgres unchanged; dev has both |
| **Constraint** | Requires multi-app awareness in promotion tooling |
| **Validates** | Promotion can be selective per-app, not all-or-nothing |

### UC-D3: Environment Rollback

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Stage deployment is unhealthy. Roll back to the previous known-good state" |
| **Trigger** | Revert MR or direct branch reset to previous commit |
| **Change** | Git history manipulation or revert commit |
| **Expected Behavior** | Stage returns to previous manifests; ArgoCD syncs the rollback |
| **Constraint** | Must not affect other environments; should be auditable |
| **Validates** | GitOps rollback works; ArgoCD correctly syncs reverted state |

### UC-D4: 3rd Party Dependency Rollout

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a platform team, I need to upgrade postgres from 16 to 17, testing in dev first, then promoting through stage→prod independently of example-app" |
| **Trigger** | Image tag update in dev's env.cue, then normal promotion workflow |
| **Change** | 3rd party image update flows through dev→stage→prod |
| **Expected Behavior** | All environments get the upgraded image; example-app unchanged |
| **Constraint** | Requires promotion to support non-CI/CD images |
| **Validates** | 3rd party images promoted correctly; app independence maintained |

### UC-D5: Skip Environment (Dev → Prod Direct)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Critical security patch needs to go to prod. Stage is currently broken for unrelated reasons" |
| **Trigger** | Direct promotion MR from dev → prod, skipping stage |
| **Change** | Image/config promotion that bypasses intermediate environment |
| **Expected Behavior** | Prod gets the fix; stage remains unchanged |
| **Constraint** | Should be rare and auditable; may require approval |
| **Validates** | Promotion chain can be bypassed when necessary |

---

## Category E: Application Code Lifecycle

Changes that originate from the **application repository** (example-app), not k8s-deployments. These demonstrate the complete CI/CD flow from code commit through production deployment.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Trigger** | Code change pushed to app repo (example-app) |
| **Flow** | App CI → Image build → MR to k8s-deployments → Manifest generation → Promotion chain |
| **Key Difference** | Categories A-D modify k8s-deployments directly; Category E starts from app code |

### UC-E1: App Version Deployment (Full Promotion)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a developer, I push a new app version and it flows through dev→stage→prod with proper version lifecycle" |
| **Trigger** | Version bump in `example-app/pom.xml`, push to GitLab |
| **Flow** | 1. Jenkins builds app, publishes SNAPSHOT to Nexus, pushes image<br>2. App CI creates MR to k8s-deployments dev branch<br>3. Merge → k8s-deployments CI generates manifests<br>4. ArgoCD syncs dev<br>5. Auto-promotion MR created for stage (version becomes RC)<br>6. Merge → CI → ArgoCD syncs stage<br>7. Auto-promotion MR created for prod (version becomes Release)<br>8. Merge → CI → ArgoCD syncs prod |
| **Expected Behavior** | Same git commit deployed to all envs with version lifecycle: SNAPSHOT (dev) → RC (stage) → Release (prod) |
| **Validates** | End-to-end pipeline: webhooks, builds, artifact publishing, MR automation, manifest generation, GitOps sync, version lifecycle |

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-e1-app-deployment.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-e1-app-deployment.sh) (implements UC-E1)

### UC-E2: App Code + Config Change Together

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "As a developer, I push a code change that also requires a new environment variable, and both flow through the pipeline together" |
| **Trigger** | Code change + `deployment/app.cue` modification in same commit |
| **Flow** | 1. Developer modifies source code AND adds `appEnvVars` entry in `deployment/app.cue`<br>2. Jenkins builds app, publishes image<br>3. App CI creates MR to k8s-deployments dev with BOTH image tag update AND merged CUE config<br>4. Merge → manifests include new env var<br>5. Promotion MRs carry both changes through stage→prod |
| **Expected Behavior** | New image AND new config deploy atomically; no partial state where image expects env var that doesn't exist |
| **Validates** | Pipeline correctly extracts and merges `deployment/app.cue` changes alongside image updates |

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-e2-code-plus-config.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-e2-code-plus-config.sh)

### UC-E3: Multiple App Versions In Flight

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "Production runs v1.0.40, stage has v1.0.41 under QA review, dev has v1.0.42 for new feature testing — all simultaneously" |
| **Trigger** | Normal development pace where promotions aren't instant |
| **Setup** | Three consecutive version bumps with deliberate pauses between promotion merges |
| **Expected Behavior** | Each environment maintains its own image tag in `env.cue`; promotions don't overwrite pending changes in other environments |
| **Validates** | Environment isolation; promotion only moves the specific app version being promoted |

*Note: This scenario emerges naturally during development. No dedicated demo script required.*

### UC-E4: App-Level Rollback

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Story** | "v1.0.42 deployed to prod has a bug. Roll back to v1.0.41 image while preserving prod's env.cue settings (replicas, resources)" |
| **Trigger** | Direct MR to prod branch updating only the image tag |
| **Change** | `deployment.image.tag: "1.0.42"` → `deployment.image.tag: "1.0.41"` |
| **Expected Behavior** | Prod rolls back to previous image; prod's replicas/resources unchanged; dev/stage unaffected |
| **Contrast with UC-D3** | D3 uses git revert (rolls back entire commit); E4 surgically changes only the image tag |
| **Validates** | Image tag can be changed independently; env.cue structure supports targeted rollback |

**Demo Script:** [`scripts/demo/demo-uc-e4-app-rollback.sh`](../scripts/demo/demo-uc-e4-app-rollback.sh)

## Implementation Notes

### Current State vs Ideal State

| Capability | Current State | Ideal State |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Env-specific changes (Category A) | Works correctly | Works correctly |
| App-level propagation (Category B) | Requires manual merge main→env | Automated via promotion |
| Platform-wide propagation (Category C) | Requires manual merge main→env | Automated via promotion |
| Override semantics | Works via CUE unification | Works via CUE unification |

### Promotion System

The current `promote-app-config.sh` only promotes:
- `deployment.image` (CI/CD managed)

Future enhancement should also promote:
- `deployment.additionalEnv` (app env vars)
- `configMap.data` (app config)
- Changes to `services/apps/*.cue`
- Changes to `services/base/` and `services/core/`

While preserving:
- `namespace`
- `replicas`
- `resources`
- `debug`
- `labels.environment`
